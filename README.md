# Hypothesis
DEPRECATED repository.
Freelancing project.
Client wants code in R that will give her result about the relation between columns of the data.

this is a small example code that match client's requirement.

In this code if we enter data and specify the columns(columns that we want to know about,significant or not,corelated or not), then code run specific HYPOTHESIS TEST AUTOMATICALLY
and after test performing code give output(For example there is significant difference between column data or these columns are positive corelated etc.)

There are 4 Test=
1. T-test----for columns that has one numeric and one category column.In this case character column has only two fields.
2. chi-square test----for columns that has only categories(characters).
3. anova test----for columns that has one numeric and one category column.In this case character column has more than two fields.
4. corelation test----for only numeric columns.
